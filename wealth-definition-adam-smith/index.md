Classical economists like Adam Smith, J.S. Mill, Ricardo, Senior and others defined economics as a science of wealth. Adam Smith, who is generally regarded as the father of 
economics, defined economics as **a science which enquires into the nature and causes of wealth of nations**. In his famous book, _An Enquiry into the Nature and Causes of the 
Wealth of Nations_, emphasised the production, growth and distribution of wealth as the subject matter of economics.

**Adam Smith (1723-90)**
Adam Smith FRSA (Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts) was a Scottish economist, philosopher, pioneer of political economy, and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Also
known as 'The Father of Economics' or 'The Father of Capitalism', Smith wrote two classic works, _The Theory of Moral Sentiments_ (1759) and _An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes 
of the Wealth of Nations_ (1776). The latter, of abbreviated as _The Wealth of Nations_, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam 
Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage.
